# A game of battleships

Hi! This material will show you how to build your own battleship game with python. This is an intermediate project, if
you still haven't done the beginner tutorials, you should try those first (or ask for some extra help with this one, that's
fine too!).

When programmers write a bigger program like this one, they don't normally sit down and write the whole thing from top to
bottom. The best way to do it is to solve just a part of the problem, run it and see that it works (or fix it if it doesn't)
and only then add new parts. So that's the way we'll build this too.
